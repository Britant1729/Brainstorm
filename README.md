Cascade Protocol Simulation with Parity Error Correction
This Python script demonstrates a simplified simulation of the Cascade error-correction protocol. The script generates random binary keys, introduces controlled errors, and then attempts to correct the errors using parity checks. It also evaluates metrics such as information leakage, error rate, and secret key rate.
# 1. Cascade Protocol Simulation with Parity Error Correction
# Features
Key Generation: Randomly generates an n-bit binary key.
Error Simulation: Introduces a specified error rate by flipping bits in the key.
Parity Checks: Divides the key into chunks of size m and calculates parity for each chunk.
Error Correction: Identifies and corrects errors in the received key by comparing parities.
Performance Metrics:
Information Leakage: Calculates the proportion of information revealed during the error correction process.
Error Rate: Computes the ratio of flipped bits to the total key length.
Secret Key Rate: Evaluates the rate of secret key generation based on error correction time and information leakage.
# How to Use
Input Parameters:
Enter the key length (n).
Enter the desired error rate (e.g., 0.1 for 10%).
Process:
The script generates a random n-bit key.
Simulates errors based on the given error rate.
Performs parity-based error correction to recover the original key.
# Output:
Displays the original key, received (error-introduced) key, and corrected key.
Outputs metrics such as error rate, information leakage, and secret key rate.
# Key Metrics
Error Rate: Proportion of bits flipped in the key.
Information Leakage: Leakage caused during error correction as (n - m)/n.
Secret Key Rate: Rate of secure key generation in bits per second, considering the time taken for error correction.
## Dependencies
# Python 3.x
# Standard libraries: random, time
# Notes
The chunk size m is determined dynamically based on the error rate to ensure effective error correction.
The calculation of the secret fraction and secret key rate provides insights into the efficiency and security of the protocol.
This script serves as a learning tool to understand error correction concepts in cryptographic protocols, specifically the Cascade protocol and its interaction with parity-based error detection.
